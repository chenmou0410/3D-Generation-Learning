## 3D presentation 
Three-dimensional data has many representations, including volume[5], point cloud[6], mesh[7], etc. Volume is a regular data structure in which objects are represented as N3 grids, which is limited by resolution and expression ability. Point cloud and mesh are irregular data structure. Compare to the voxel, both of them are better at representing a three-dimensional object. Mesh have rich shape details which better in display and Point cloud is easier to calculate which widely used in the underlayer of 3d model design.
